# Paternity-Assignment
Code for preparing files for use with CERVUS to assign paternity from microsatellite genotypes

We collect tissue samples from all newborn pups in the population and all immigrants.  Tissue samples are genotyped at XX microsatellite loci in Dave Coltman's lab (Western University).  These lab data are uploaded into krsp_suppl in the 'genotypes' table.  The code in this repository were written by Ty Wagner with help and advice from Andrew McAdam to be able to create the two files that are needed for upload into CERVUS to assign paternity to offspring based on these genotypes.

This repository also includes a Word doc that provides a step-by-step guide to creating and using the required files in Cervus.
