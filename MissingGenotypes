#This code builds on the cervus_prep function to look for errors in missing genotypes in the database. It allows pulling a list of candidate juveniles by birth year, and looks for errors associated with missing genotypes for vials/squirrels. 


#Cervus Prep - this function and example code is by Ty Wagner with advice from Andrew McAdam 

# Description
# Using data from the krsp DB, converts a vector of squirrel_ids into the files
# required to make Cervus paternity assignments

# Usage
# cervus_prep(juv_ids)

# Arguments
# juv_ids: a vector of squirrel_ids that can be coerced to type numeric.

# Value
# A list of 2 data.frames: IDs and gtypes. IDs contains the user-supplied
# juv_ids in col1, their dams (if known) in col2, and a list of candidate sires in
# col3. Cervus refers to this as the "offspring" file. gtypes contains the
# genotypes of all squirrels present in IDs.

#Define function 
```{r}
cervus_prep <- function(juv_ids) {
  
  # connect to krspDB; pull gtypes and flastall-------------------------------------------------------
